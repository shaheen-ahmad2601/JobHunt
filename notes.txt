1 - created a server and imported dependencies which is required for the project
2- create a database MongoDb and connect through mongoose
 - created cluster and coppied url
 - created .env file
 - connected with port

3 - created util folder and connect db with mongoose 
 - and call the in server - DB connect uptill this point

4- now create models - basically its a schema like what are the fields and all needs to be shown
 - we can create as many as schema we want basically we need to define the type of data 
 - string number etc

 ------------------------schema created------------------------


 5 - controller - business logic
 - write registration logic
 - then login logic and check for validation if user exists
 - logout logic
 - update logic

 6: create  routes
   -  middlewares
   - then check the apis
   - registration api route
   - login api route
   - update api route
   - logout api route
   - checked apis on postman

once logged out and if we try to update the user details then should show user not authenticated
why because, logged out means cookies has been deleted means token is not there then it will not work.


7: import in index.js file
 controller - business logic
 models - structure
 routes - for routing
 import - index.js file : main file

8: completed all routes and checked all the apis
- db is also working fine
